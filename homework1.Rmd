```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=TRUE, error=TRUE)
```

```{r}
salary <- read.csv("/Users/quynh/Documents/Salary.csv", header = TRUE)
data <- salary$Salary
hist(data, xlab='Salary', main = 'histogram of salary')
```


The distribution is skewed to the right, with only a single peak. Thus, this is a unimodel distribution. About 10 to 15% of the data ranges from 40 to 70 while only 5% earned less or more than that.
```{r}
mean(data)
sd(data)
```
the mean of the data is 65.6, while std deviation is 30.8 (pretty large)
